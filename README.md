#### Hey! My name is pronoused Ma-knee-yah. I was born and raised in Liberia, Monrovia and moved to the states when I was 8 years old. I'm currently enrolled in Savvy Coders Data Analytics and Phython Cohort. It's a completely new path for me, but I'm so excited to see where this course takes me!

    - Learn SQL and Python.
    - Get a job as a data analytist after completion of the course.
    - Become comfortable using the terminals.
    - Learn how to use Github and Jira.
    - Familarize myself with the roles of a Product Owner and Scrum Master.

Coding can be challeging at times (honestly most times) but I get so happy whenever I get it right, regardless of how many tries it may take. This is a visual represenation of my excitement when I was able to complete this homework.
